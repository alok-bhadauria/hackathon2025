Problem Statement 11 : 

    Vision-Based Soil Quality Assessment for Precision Agriculture

1. Problem Description :

        Soil quality assessments typically require lab test. Vision-based predictions offer rapid insights but must handle noisy real-world conditions.

2. Objectives :

        i. Predict soil properties from images.

        ii. Handle lighting and device variation.

        iii. Support precision farming.

3. Key features :

        i. Surface soil images.

        ii. Texture/ color cues.

        iii. Environmental metadata.

5. Literature Survey :

        i. Vision-based agricultural ML.

        ii. Soil classification via imagery.

        iii. Domain adaptation vision transformers.

7. Methodology & Experimental Plan :

        i. Fine-tune ViT.

        ii. Predict multiple soil labels.

        iii. Domain adaptation for label -> field shift.

Experiments :
    
    i. Cross-domain generalization.
    
    ii. Lighting augmentation effects.
    
    iii. Ablation on sensors.

6. Datasets :

        i. Public soil datasets.
   
        ii. OnField Soil Dataset.

7. Expected Contributions :
   
        i. Fast, low-cost soil quality predictor.
   
        ii. Better crop planning and precision farming.
